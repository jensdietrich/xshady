# [CVE-2017-15717 -- sling](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-15717) from [vul4j](https://github.com/tuhh-softsec/vul4j)

Project uses `org.apache.sling:org.apache.sling.xss:2.0.0`, tests from https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-xss/commit/ec6764d165abc4df8cffd8439761bb2228887db9 as specified in [vul4j](https://github.com/tuhh-softsec/vul4j) `VUL4J-25`.

Some minor changes made:
1. JUnit version replaced by JUnit5, not using vintage
2. `pom.xml` based on the CVE-2016-5394 POV in this repo, with several additional dependencies and 1 dependency removed
3. Resource `resources/SLING-INF/content/config.xml` added (needed in fixture). The location is unusual but better than the original location in `src/main/resources/SLING-INF/content/config.xml` referenced as file (not resource)
4. Resource `resources/configWithoutHref.xml` added at modified path (needed by `testGetValidHrefWithoutHrefConfig()`)

Note that the tests __fail__ indicating the vulnerability!

Passes when the dependency on `org.apache.sling:org.apache.sling.xss:2.0.0` in `pom.xml` is changed to the next version available in the Maven repo, namely `2.0.4`.
