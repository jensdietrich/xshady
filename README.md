# xshady

This repo contains some projects that demonstrate the presence of some known vulnerabilities in libraries. This can be used as input for security analyses in related libraries. A key feature is that the vulnerabilities are testable, and the projects follow a structure that makes them easy to refactor if the analysis requires it. Projects also contain the reports produced by some SCA tools -- this can be used to check those tools for soundness / recall , using the testable projects as oracles.

## Project Structure

Each project is named `CVE*`, uses the standard Maven repository layout, and has a single test. If this test succeeds, the vulnerability refered to by the CVE in the name is present.

The `pom.xml` defines / should define the Java version to be used by setting the  `<maven.compiler.target>` and `<maven.compiler.source>` properties, in most case this is set to `11`.

Some tests may have additional requirements wrt Java version and OS, those are enforced by JUNit preconditions. When those fail, the respective test(s) will be skipped. I.e. the presence of a vulnerability is shown by all tests passing, and **not** by none of the tests failing. I.e. `mvn test` succeeded is not sufficient, surefire reports (in `target/surefire`) must be inspected to ensure that no test was skipped.

Each project points to a vulnerability in a Maven artifact. This artifact can be found in the dependency section in `pom.xml`. Note that there is always an additional dependency to junit5 which is used for testing. 


## Running Software Composition Security Analyses

The projects can be used to test various SCA tools as follows: 

### Dependabot 

The analysis is run on GitHub, check the dependabopt [result page](https://github.com/jensdietrich/xshady/security/dependabot) for the projects detected as being vulnerable.


### OWASP Dependency Check

To run the check locally via the CLI, follow [instructions](https://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/dependency-check-cli/index.html) to install the tool, the run the following command from a terminal after CDiing into the project folder:

`dependency-check -scan . -f CSV` (some other output formats are supported as well)

Scan results are committed to the repo, the reports are generated by running

`dependency-check -scan . -f JSON -o scan-results/dependency-check -prettyPrint`

and are available in `<project>/scan-results/dependency-check/`.


### Snyk

Follow the [instructions](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli) to install snyk, then run `snyk auth` before using it for the first time. 

After succesful authentication, run `snyk test` in each project folder. 

Scan results are committed to the repo, the reports are generated by running

`snyk test --json --json-file-output=scan-results/snyk/snyk-report.json`

 and are available in `<project>/scan-results/snyk/`.
  
### IntelliJ IDEA 2022.2 (Ultimate Edition) / CheckMarx

IntelliJ has built-in support to detect vulnerable dependencies. To run this analysis requires to load the respective projects into the IDE. Then click on the project's `pom.xml`, and run `Analyze > Show Vulnerable Dependencies`. This will display a view with vulnerable dependencies. 

This functionality is based on [checkmarx](https://checkmarx.com/).   

## A Note on Reproducibility 

The security tools use an evolving database, so generally, re-running a scan may return more vulnerabilties than reported. Check the respective reports for meta data such as versions, and the commit dates for the database that was used.
