# [CVE-2018-1324](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1324) from [vul4j](https://github.com/tuhh-softsec/vul4j)

Project reproduces CVE-2018-1324 using CVE-specific test from a
[vul4j commit](https://github.com/tuhh-softsec/vul4j/commit/45ddad15edd0f56a38d1d10e1ac6e1c2de9de881).

The test has been rewritten to succeed if the vul4j test times out. The original test seems to be sensitive to timing,
i.e. the fixed versions may not complete within the timeout given a slow environment, thus timeout was increased to 12
seconds.
