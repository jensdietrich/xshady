# [CVE-2016-0779](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-0779) based on [`VUL4J-37`](https://github.com/tuhh-softsec/vul4j)

Project uses `org.apache.openejb:apache-tomee`, and the test added in https://github.com/apache/tomee/commit/58cdbbef9c77ab2b44870f9d606593b49cde76d9 as specified in `VUL4J-37`.

NOTE: [The NVD "rejects" vul4j's original CVE `CVE-2015-8581`](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-8581) as a dupe of `CVE-2016-0779`. This PoV is based on the latter CVE.

**NOTE: [The Maven central repo](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.openejb/apache-tomee) does NOT currently show any versions of this artifact as being vulnerable to either this CVE or the original!**

**NOTE: According to the CVE, this vulnerability affects not only `org.apache.openejb:apache-tomee` versions before `1.7.4`, but also `org.apache.tomee:apache-tomee` versions before `7.0.0-M3`.** The metadata in `pom.xml` and `pov-project.json` here only deals with the first set of GAVs (with group `org.apache.openejb`), which turns out to be older, but I also verified that the 2 versions of `org.apache.tomee:apache-tomee` before `7.0.0-M3` (namely `7.0.0-M2` and `7.0.0-M1`) fail the test while `7.0.0-M3` passes. No code changes were required for this.

Since [the underlying GHSA](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g7jw-7782-jjv9) has not yet been verified, it isn't retrievable from https://api.osv.dev/v1/vulns/GHSA-g7jw-7782-jjv9 (see issue #15) so could not be used to generate `pov-project.json` automatically. I created it manually by testing each of the GAVs listed at https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.openejb/apache-tomee; most (all 1.6.x or earlier) didn't build at all, but I have left them in the `pov-project.json` for now.

`1.7.3`->`1.7.4` is a failure->success transition for `org.apache.openejb:apache-tomee`, and `7.0.0-M2`->`7.0.0-M3` is a failure->success transition for `org.apache.tomee:apache-tomee`.
