# [CVE-2019-0225 -- jspwiki] (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-0225 )  from [vul4j](https://github.com/tuhh-softsec/vul4j)


Project uses `org.apache.jspwiki:jspwiki-main:2.11.0.M6` , tests from https://github.com/apache/jspwiki/commit/88d89d6523802c044cfcb7930cba40d8eeb21da2#  
as specified in [vul4j](https://github.com/tuhh-softsec/vul4j).

Some minor changes made: 
1. JUnit version replaced by Junit5 with JUnit4 support through vintage
2. additional dependency providing mock APIs added: `net.sourceforge.stripes:stripes:1.7.0-async-beta`

Note that the tests __fail__ indicating the vulnerability!

The commit, apache/jspwiki@88d89d6, that contains the original patch to fix the vulnerability also contains a new test -- but that test has a bug, which
was fixed a few minutes later in apache/jspwiki@3ad9e5e. Our test has the same fix.
