It mishandles the interaction between serialization gadgets and typing, related to `org.apache.commons.dbcp2.datasources.PerUserPoolDataSource`.\n\n## Details\n\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part of popular protocols like _Remote Method Invocation (RMI)_, _Java Management Extension (JMX)_, _Java Messaging System (JMS)_, _Action Message Format (AMF)_, _Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState_, etc.\n\n_Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)), is when the application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\nJava deserialization issues have been known for years. However, interest in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes that could be abused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular library (Apache Commons Collection)](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSCOLLECTIONS-30078). These classes were used in zero-days affecting IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.\n\n  \nAn attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the deserializer, getting the command executed.\n  \n\n> Developers put too much trust in Java Object Serialization. Some even de-serialize objects pre-authentication. When deserializing an Object in Java you typically cast it to an expected type, and therefore Java's strict type system will ensure you only get valid object trees. Unfortunately, by the time the type checking happens, platform code has already created and executed significant logic. So, before the final type is checked a lot of code is executed from the readObject() methods of various objects, all of which is out of the developer's control. By combining the readObject() methods of various classes which are available on the classpath of the vulnerable application an attacker can execute functions (including calling Runtime.exec() to execute local OS commands).\n\n- Apache Blog\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.9.10.8 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2986)\n",

      "description": "## Overview\n[com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind) is a library which contains the general-purpose data-binding functionality and tree-model for Jackson Data Processor.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Deserialization of Untrusted Data. It mishandles the interaction between serialization gadgets and typing, related to `org.apache.commons.dbcp2.datasources.SharedPoolDataSource`.\n\n## Details\n\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part of popular protocols like _Remote Method Invocation (RMI)_, _Java Management Extension (JMX)_, _Java Messaging System (JMS)_, _Action Message Format (AMF)_, _Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState_, etc.\n\n_Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)), is when the application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\nJava deserialization issues have been known for years. However, interest in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes that could be abused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular library (Apache Commons Collection)](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSCOLLECTIONS-30078). These classes were used in zero-days affecting IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.\n\n  \nAn attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the deserializer, getting the command executed.\n  \n\n> Developers put too much trust in Java Object Serialization. Some even de-serialize objects pre-authentication. When deserializing an Object in Java you typically cast it to an expected type, and therefore Java's strict type system will ensure you only get valid object trees. Unfortunately, by the time the type checking happens, platform code has already created and executed significant logic. So, before the final type is checked a lot of code is executed from the readObject() methods of various objects, all of which is out of the developer's control. By combining the readObject() methods of various classes which are available on the classpath of the vulnerable application an attacker can execute functions (including calling Runtime.exec() to execute local OS commands).\n\n- Apache Blog\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.9.10.8 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2986)\n",

If an application using this dependency has the ability to deserialize a JSON string from an untrusted source, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to conduct deserialization attacks.\n\nExploitation of unsafe deserialization attacks through `jackson-databind` requires the following prerequisites: \n\n### 1. The target application allowing JSON user input which is processed by jackson-databind\n\nAn application using `jackson-databind` is only vulnerable if a user-provided JSON data is deserialized. \n\n### 2. Polymorphic type handling for properties with nominal type are enabled\n\nPolymorphic type handling refers to the addition of enough type information so that the deserializer can instantiate the appropriate subtype of a value. Use of \"default typing\" is considered dangerous due to the possibility of an untrusted method (gadget) managing to specify a class that is accessible through the class-loader and therefore, exposing a set of methods and/or fields.\n\n### 3. An exploitable gadget class is available for the attacker to leverage \n\nGadget chains are specially crafted method sequences that can be created by an attacker in order to change the flow of code execution. These gadgets are often methods introduced by third-party components which an attacker could utilise in order to attack the target application. Not every gadget out there is supported by `jackson-databind`. The maintainers of `jackson-databind` proactively blacklists possible serialization gadgets in an attempt to ensure that it is not possible for an attacker to chain gadgets during serialization. \n\n### Further reading:\n\n - [On Jackson CVEs: Donâ€™t Panic on Medium](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n - [NCC Group Jackson Deserialization WhitePaper](https://www.nccgroup.com/globalassets/our-research/us/whitepapers/2018/jackson_deserialization.pdf)\n - [Java Security Best Practices](https://snyk.io/blog/10-java-security-best-practices/)\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.9.10.8 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2999)\n- [Medium Post](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n- [PoC](https://github.com/Al1ex/CVE-2020-35728)\n",

The package mishandles the interaction between serialization gadgets and typing, related to `org.apache.tomcat.dbcp.dbcp2.cpdsadapter.DriverAdapterCPDS`.\n\n## Details\n\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating objects from a  sequence of bytes is called deserialization. _Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)) occurs when an application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, allowing the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\n`com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` allows deserialization of JSON input to Java objects. If an application using this dependency has the ability to deserialize a JSON string from an untrusted source, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to conduct deserialization attacks.\n\nExploitation of unsafe deserialization attacks through `jackson-databind` requires the following prerequisites: \n\n### 1. The target application allowing JSON user input which is processed by jackson-databind\n\nAn application using `jackson-databind` is only vulnerable if a user-provided JSON data is deserialized. \n\n### 2. Polymorphic type handling for properties with nominal type are enabled\n\nPolymorphic type handling refers to the addition of enough type information so that the deserializer can instantiate the appropriate subtype of a value. Use of \"default typing\" is considered dangerous due to the possibility of an untrusted method (gadget) managing to specify a class that is accessible through the class-loader and therefore, exposing a set of methods and/or fields.\n\n### 3. An exploitable gadget class is available for the attacker to leverage \n\nGadget chains are specially crafted method sequences that can be created by an attacker in order to change the flow of code execution. These gadgets are often methods introduced by third-party components which an attacker could utilise in order to attack the target application. Not every gadget out there is supported by `jackson-databind`. The maintainers of `jackson-databind` proactively blacklists possible serialization gadgets in an attempt to ensure that it is not possible for an attacker to chain gadgets during serialization. \n\n### Further reading:\n\n - [On Jackson CVEs: Donâ€™t Panic on Medium](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n - [NCC Group Jackson Deserialization WhitePaper](https://www.nccgroup.com/globalassets/our-research/us/whitepapers/2018/jackson_deserialization.pdf)\n - [Java Security Best Practices](https://snyk.io/blog/10-java-security-best-practices/)\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.9.10.8 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3004)\n- [Medium Article](https://cowtowncoder.medium.com/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n- [PoC](https://github.com/Al1ex/CVE-2020-36179)\n",

      "description": "## Overview\n[com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind) is a library which contains the general-purpose data-binding functionality and tree-model for Jackson Data Processor.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Deserialization of Untrusted Data. A malicious user could perform a SSRF attack via the `javax.swing` gadget (specifically `javax.swing.JTextPane`).\n\n## Details\n\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part of popular protocols like _Remote Method Invocation (RMI)_, _Java Management Extension (JMX)_, _Java Messaging System (JMS)_, _Action Message Format (AMF)_, _Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState_, etc.\n\n_Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)), is when the application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\nJava deserialization issues have been known for years. However, interest in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes that could be abused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular library (Apache Commons Collection)](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSCOLLECTIONS-30078). These classes were used in zero-days affecting IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.\n\n  \nAn attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the deserializer, getting the command executed.\n  \n\n> Developers put too much trust in Java Object Serialization. Some even de-serialize objects pre-authentication. When deserializing an Object in Java you typically cast it to an expected type, and therefore Java's strict type system will ensure you only get valid object trees. Unfortunately, by the time the type checking happens, platform code has already created and executed significant logic. So, before the final type is checked a lot of code is executed from the readObject() methods of various objects, all of which is out of the developer's control. By combining the readObject() methods of various classes which are available on the classpath of the vulnerable application an attacker can execute functions (including calling Runtime.exec() to execute local OS commands).\n\n- Apache Blog\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.9.10.7 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/7dbf51bf78d157098074a20bd9da39bd48c18e4a)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2854)\n- [GitHub Release](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/releases/tag/jackson-databind-2.9.10.7)\n- [RedHat Bugzilla Bug](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1916633)\n",

      "description": "## Overview\n[com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind) is a library which contains the general-purpose data-binding functionality and tree-model for Jackson Data Processor.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Deserialization of Untrusted Data. When Default Typing is enabled for an externally exposed JSON endpoint, the service has the mysql-connector-java jar in the classpath. An attacker can host a crafted MySQL server reachable by the victim and send a crafted JSON message that allows them to read arbitrary local files on the server. This occurs due to missing `com.mysql.cj.jdbc.admin.MiniAdmin` validation.\n\n## Details\n\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating objects from a  sequence of bytes is called deserialization. _Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)) occurs when an application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, allowing the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\n`com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` allows deserialization of JSON input to Java objects. If an application using this dependency has the ability to deserialize a JSON string from an untrusted source, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to conduct deserialization attacks.\n\nExploitation of unsafe deserialization attacks through `jackson-databind` requires the following prerequisites: \n\n### 1. The target application allowing JSON user input which is processed by jackson-databind\n\nAn application using `jackson-databind` is only vulnerable if a user-provided JSON data is deserialized. \n\n### 2. Polymorphic type handling for properties with nominal type are enabled\n\nPolymorphic type handling refers to the addition of enough type information so that the deserializer can instantiate the appropriate subtype of a value. Use of \"default typing\" is considered dangerous due to the possibility of an untrusted method (gadget) managing to specify a class that is accessible through the class-loader and therefore, exposing a set of methods and/or fields.\n\n### 3. An exploitable gadget class is available for the attacker to leverage \n\nGadget chains are specially crafted method sequences that can be created by an attacker in order to change the flow of code execution. These gadgets are often methods introduced by third-party components which an attacker could utilise in order to attack the target application. Not every gadget out there is supported by `jackson-databind`. The maintainers of `jackson-databind` proactively blacklists possible serialization gadgets in an attempt to ensure that it is not possible for an attacker to chain gadgets during serialization. \n\n### Further reading:\n\n - [On Jackson CVEs: Donâ€™t Panic on Medium](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n - [NCC Group Jackson Deserialization WhitePaper](https://www.nccgroup.com/globalassets/our-research/us/whitepapers/2018/jackson_deserialization.pdf)\n - [Java Security Best Practices](https://snyk.io/blog/10-java-security-best-practices/)\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.9.9, 2.8.11.4, 2.7.9.6, 2.6.7.3 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/dda513bd7251b4f32b7b60b1c13740e3b5a43024)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2326)\n- [Github Release Tag](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Release-2.9.9)\n- [PoC](https://github.com/Al1ex/CVE-2019-12086)\n",

      "description": "## Overview\n[com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind) is a library which contains the general-purpose data-binding functionality and tree-model for Jackson Data Processor.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Deserialization of Untrusted Data. An attacker may exploit this issue by sending a maliciously crafted input to the `readValue` method of the `ObjectMapper`.\n\n## Details\n\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating objects from a  sequence of bytes is called deserialization. _Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)) occurs when an application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, allowing the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\n`com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` allows deserialization of JSON input to Java objects. If an application using this dependency has the ability to deserialize a JSON string from an untrusted source, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to conduct deserialization attacks.\n\nExploitation of unsafe deserialization attacks through `jackson-databind` requires the following prerequisites: \n\n### 1. The target application allowing JSON user input which is processed by jackson-databind\n\nAn application using `jackson-databind` is only vulnerable if a user-provided JSON data is deserialized. \n\n### 2. Polymorphic type handling for properties with nominal type are enabled\n\nPolymorphic type handling refers to the addition of enough type information so that the deserializer can instantiate the appropriate subtype of a value. Use of \"default typing\" is considered dangerous due to the possibility of an untrusted method (gadget) managing to specify a class that is accessible through the class-loader and therefore, exposing a set of methods and/or fields.\n\n### 3. An exploitable gadget class is available for the attacker to leverage \n\nGadget chains are specially crafted method sequences that can be created by an attacker in order to change the flow of code execution. These gadgets are often methods introduced by third-party components which an attacker could utilise in order to attack the target application. Not every gadget out there is supported by `jackson-databind`. The maintainers of `jackson-databind` proactively blacklists possible serialization gadgets in an attempt to ensure that it is not possible for an attacker to chain gadgets during serialization. \n\n### Further reading:\n\n - [On Jackson CVEs: Donâ€™t Panic on Medium](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n - [NCC Group Jackson Deserialization WhitePaper](https://www.nccgroup.com/globalassets/our-research/us/whitepapers/2018/jackson_deserialization.pdf)\n - [Java Security Best Practices](https://snyk.io/blog/10-java-security-best-practices/)\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.6.7.1, 2.7.9.1, 2.8.9 or higher.\n## References\n- [Exploit](https://github.com/JavanXD/Demo-Exploit-Jackson-RCE)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/60d459cedcf079c6106ae7da2ac562bc32dcabe1)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1599)\n- [RedHat Bugzilla Bug](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id&#x3D;1462702)\n",

      "description": "## Overview\n[com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind) is a library which contains the general-purpose data-binding functionality and tree-model for Jackson Data Processor.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Deserialization of Untrusted Data. A Polymorphic Typing issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x through 2.9.9. When Default Typing is enabled (either globally or for a specific property) for an externally exposed JSON endpoint and the service has JDOM 1.x or 2.x jar in the classpath, an attacker can send a specifically crafted JSON message that allows them to read arbitrary local files on the server.\n\n## Details\n\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating objects from a  sequence of bytes is called deserialization. _Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)) occurs when an application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, allowing the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\n`com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` allows deserialization of JSON input to Java objects. If an application using this dependency has the ability to deserialize a JSON string from an untrusted source, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to conduct deserialization attacks.\n\nExploitation of unsafe deserialization attacks through `jackson-databind` requires the following prerequisites: \n\n### 1. The target application allowing JSON user input which is processed by jackson-databind\n\nAn application using `jackson-databind` is only vulnerable if a user-provided JSON data is deserialized. \n\n### 2. Polymorphic type handling for properties with nominal type are enabled\n\nPolymorphic type handling refers to the addition of enough type information so that the deserializer can instantiate the appropriate subtype of a value. Use of \"default typing\" is considered dangerous due to the possibility of an untrusted method (gadget) managing to specify a class that is accessible through the class-loader and therefore, exposing a set of methods and/or fields.\n\n### 3. An exploitable gadget class is available for the attacker to leverage \n\nGadget chains are specially crafted method sequences that can be created by an attacker in order to change the flow of code execution. These gadgets are often methods introduced by third-party components which an attacker could utilise in order to attack the target application. Not every gadget out there is supported by `jackson-databind`. The maintainers of `jackson-databind` proactively blacklists possible serialization gadgets in an attempt to ensure that it is not possible for an attacker to chain gadgets during serialization. \n\n### Further reading:\n\n - [On Jackson CVEs: Donâ€™t Panic on Medium](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n - [NCC Group Jackson Deserialization WhitePaper](https://www.nccgroup.com/globalassets/our-research/us/whitepapers/2018/jackson_deserialization.pdf)\n - [Java Security Best Practices](https://snyk.io/blog/10-java-security-best-practices/)\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.9.9.1, 2.8.11.4, 2.7.9.6 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/5f7c69bba07a7155adde130d9dee2e54a54f1fa5)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2341)\n- [PoC Repository](https://github.com/Al1ex/CVE-2019-12814)\n",

The reverse process of creating objects from a  sequence of bytes is called deserialization. _Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)) occurs when an application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, allowing the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\n`com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` allows deserialization of JSON input to Java objects. If an application using this dependency has the ability to deserialize a JSON string from an untrusted source, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to conduct deserialization attacks.\n\nExploitation of unsafe deserialization attacks through `jackson-databind` requires the following prerequisites: \n\n### 1. The target application allowing JSON user input which is processed by jackson-databind\n\nAn application using `jackson-databind` is only vulnerable if a user-provided JSON data is deserialized. \n\n### 2. Polymorphic type handling for properties with nominal type are enabled\n\nPolymorphic type handling refers to the addition of enough type information so that the deserializer can instantiate the appropriate subtype of a value. Use of \"default typing\" is considered dangerous due to the possibility of an untrusted method (gadget) managing to specify a class that is accessible through the class-loader and therefore, exposing a set of methods and/or fields.\n\n### 3. An exploitable gadget class is available for the attacker to leverage \n\nGadget chains are specially crafted method sequences that can be created by an attacker in order to change the flow of code execution. These gadgets are often methods introduced by third-party components which an attacker could utilise in order to attack the target application. Not every gadget out there is supported by `jackson-databind`. The maintainers of `jackson-databind` proactively blacklists possible serialization gadgets in an attempt to ensure that it is not possible for an attacker to chain gadgets during serialization. \n\n### Further reading:\n\n - [On Jackson CVEs: Donâ€™t Panic on Medium](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n - [NCC Group Jackson Deserialization WhitePaper](https://www.nccgroup.com/globalassets/our-research/us/whitepapers/2018/jackson_deserialization.pdf)\n - [Java Security Best Practices](https://snyk.io/blog/10-java-security-best-practices/)\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.9.9.2, 2.8.11.4, 2.7.9.6 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Comparison](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/compare/jackson-databind-2.9.9.1...jackson-databind-2.9.9.2)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2387)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2389)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2395)\n- [Snyk Blog](https://snyk.io/blog/jackson-deserialization-vulnerability/)\n",

If an application using this dependency has the ability to deserialize a JSON string from an untrusted source, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to conduct deserialization attacks.\n\nExploitation of unsafe deserialization attacks through `jackson-databind` requires the following prerequisites: \n\n### 1. The target application allowing JSON user input which is processed by jackson-databind\n\nAn application using `jackson-databind` is only vulnerable if a user-provided JSON data is deserialized. \n\n### 2. Polymorphic type handling for properties with nominal type are enabled\n\nPolymorphic type handling refers to the addition of enough type information so that the deserializer can instantiate the appropriate subtype of a value. Use of \"default typing\" is considered dangerous due to the possibility of an untrusted method (gadget) managing to specify a class that is accessible through the class-loader and therefore, exposing a set of methods and/or fields.\n\n### 3. An exploitable gadget class is available for the attacker to leverage \n\nGadget chains are specially crafted method sequences that can be created by an attacker in order to change the flow of code execution. These gadgets are often methods introduced by third-party components which an attacker could utilise in order to attack the target application. Not every gadget out there is supported by `jackson-databind`. The maintainers of `jackson-databind` proactively blacklists possible serialization gadgets in an attempt to ensure that it is not possible for an attacker to chain gadgets during serialization. \n\n### Further reading:\n\n - [On Jackson CVEs: Donâ€™t Panic on Medium](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n - [NCC Group Jackson Deserialization WhitePaper](https://www.nccgroup.com/globalassets/our-research/us/whitepapers/2018/jackson_deserialization.pdf)\n - [Java Security Best Practices](https://snyk.io/blog/10-java-security-best-practices/)\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.9.10, 2.8.11.5, 2.6.7.3 or higher.\n## References\n- [Exploit](https://github.com/LeadroyaL/cve-2019-14540-exploit)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/d4983c740fec7d5576b207a8c30a63d3ea7443de)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2410)\n",

      "description": "## Overview\n[com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind) is a library which contains the general-purpose data-binding functionality and tree-model for Jackson Data Processor.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Deserialization of Untrusted Data. Two additional `net.sf.ehcache` gadgets are not blacklisted.\n\n## Details\n\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating objects from a  sequence of bytes is called deserialization. _Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)) occurs when an application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, allowing the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\n`com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` allows deserialization of JSON input to Java objects. If an application using this dependency has the ability to deserialize a JSON string from an untrusted source, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to conduct deserialization attacks.\n\nExploitation of unsafe deserialization attacks through `jackson-databind` requires the following prerequisites: \n\n### 1. The target application allowing JSON user input which is processed by jackson-databind\n\nAn application using `jackson-databind` is only vulnerable if a user-provided JSON data is deserialized. \n\n### 2. Polymorphic type handling for properties with nominal type are enabled\n\nPolymorphic type handling refers to the addition of enough type information so that the deserializer can instantiate the appropriate subtype of a value. Use of \"default typing\" is considered dangerous due to the possibility of an untrusted method (gadget) managing to specify a class that is accessible through the class-loader and therefore, exposing a set of methods and/or fields.\n\n### 3. An exploitable gadget class is available for the attacker to leverage \n\nGadget chains are specially crafted method sequences that can be created by an attacker in order to change the flow of code execution. These gadgets are often methods introduced by third-party components which an attacker could utilise in order to attack the target application. Not every gadget out there is supported by `jackson-databind`. The maintainers of `jackson-databind` proactively blacklists possible serialization gadgets in an attempt to ensure that it is not possible for an attacker to chain gadgets during serialization. \n\n### Further reading:\n\n - [On Jackson CVEs: Donâ€™t Panic on Medium](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n - [NCC Group Jackson Deserialization WhitePaper](https://www.nccgroup.com/globalassets/our-research/us/whitepapers/2018/jackson_deserialization.pdf)\n - [Java Security Best Practices](https://snyk.io/blog/10-java-security-best-practices/)\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.9.10.2 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/fc4214a883dc087070f25da738ef0d49c2f3387e)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2526)\n",

Mishandles the interaction between serialization gadgets and typing, related to:\r\n\r\n* `com.ibatis.sqlmap.engine.transaction.jta.JtaTransactionConfig` (aka `ibatis-sqlmap`)\r\n* `br.com.anteros.dbcp.AnterosDBCPConfig` (aka `anteros-core`)\r\n* `org.apache.hadoop.shaded.com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariConfig` (aka shaded `hikari-config`)\n\n## Details\n\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating objects from a  sequence of bytes is called deserialization. _Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)) occurs when an application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, allowing the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\n`com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` allows deserialization of JSON input to Java objects. If an application using this dependency has the ability to deserialize a JSON string from an untrusted source, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to conduct deserialization attacks.\n\nExploitation of unsafe deserialization attacks through `jackson-databind` requires the following prerequisites: \n\n### 1. The target application allowing JSON user input which is processed by jackson-databind\n\nAn application using `jackson-databind` is only vulnerable if a user-provided JSON data is deserialized. \n\n### 2. Polymorphic type handling for properties with nominal type are enabled\n\nPolymorphic type handling refers to the addition of enough type information so that the deserializer can instantiate the appropriate subtype of a value. Use of \"default typing\" is considered dangerous due to the possibility of an untrusted method (gadget) managing to specify a class that is accessible through the class-loader and therefore, exposing a set of methods and/or fields.\n\n### 3. An exploitable gadget class is available for the attacker to leverage \n\nGadget chains are specially crafted method sequences that can be created by an attacker in order to change the flow of code execution. These gadgets are often methods introduced by third-party components which an attacker could utilise in order to attack the target application. Not every gadget out there is supported by `jackson-databind`. The maintainers of `jackson-databind` proactively blacklists possible serialization gadgets in an attempt to ensure that it is not possible for an attacker to chain gadgets during serialization. \n\n### Further reading:\n\n - [On Jackson CVEs: Donâ€™t Panic on Medium](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n - [NCC Group Jackson Deserialization WhitePaper](https://www.nccgroup.com/globalassets/our-research/us/whitepapers/2018/jackson_deserialization.pdf)\n - [Java Security Best Practices](https://snyk.io/blog/10-java-security-best-practices/)\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.6.7.4, 2.7.9.7, 2.8.11.6, 2.9.10.4 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/9f4e97019fb0dd836533d0b6198c88787e235ae2)\n- [Github Issue #1](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2634)\n- [GitHub Issue #2](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2631)\n- [GitHub PoC](https://github.com/fairyming/CVE-2020-9548)\n",

If an application using this dependency has the ability to deserialize a JSON string from an untrusted source, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to conduct deserialization attacks.\n\nExploitation of unsafe deserialization attacks through `jackson-databind` requires the following prerequisites: \n\n### 1. The target application allowing JSON user input which is processed by jackson-databind\n\nAn application using `jackson-databind` is only vulnerable if a user-provided JSON data is deserialized. \n\n### 2. Polymorphic type handling for properties with nominal type are enabled\n\nPolymorphic type handling refers to the addition of enough type information so that the deserializer can instantiate the appropriate subtype of a value. Use of \"default typing\" is considered dangerous due to the possibility of an untrusted method (gadget) managing to specify a class that is accessible through the class-loader and therefore, exposing a set of methods and/or fields.\n\n### 3. An exploitable gadget class is available for the attacker to leverage \n\nGadget chains are specially crafted method sequences that can be created by an attacker in order to change the flow of code execution. These gadgets are often methods introduced by third-party components which an attacker could utilise in order to attack the target application. Not every gadget out there is supported by `jackson-databind`. The maintainers of `jackson-databind` proactively blacklists possible serialization gadgets in an attempt to ensure that it is not possible for an attacker to chain gadgets during serialization. \n\n### Further reading:\n\n - [On Jackson CVEs: Donâ€™t Panic on Medium](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n - [NCC Group Jackson Deserialization WhitePaper](https://www.nccgroup.com/globalassets/our-research/us/whitepapers/2018/jackson_deserialization.pdf)\n - [Java Security Best Practices](https://snyk.io/blog/10-java-security-best-practices/)\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.6.7.4, 2.9.10.4 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit (Master)](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/592872f4235c7f2a3280725278da55544032f72d)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2659)\n- [On Jackson CVEs: Donâ€™t Panic](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n",

It mishandles the interaction between serialization gadgets and typing, related to `org.apache.commons.jelly.impl.Embedded` (aka `commons-jelly`).\n\n## Details\n\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating objects from a  sequence of bytes is called deserialization. _Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)) occurs when an application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, allowing the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\n`com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` allows deserialization of JSON input to Java objects. If an application using this dependency has the ability to deserialize a JSON string from an untrusted source, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to conduct deserialization attacks.\n\nExploitation of unsafe deserialization attacks through `jackson-databind` requires the following prerequisites: \n\n### 1. The target application allowing JSON user input which is processed by jackson-databind\n\nAn application using `jackson-databind` is only vulnerable if a user-provided JSON data is deserialized. \n\n### 2. Polymorphic type handling for properties with nominal type are enabled\n\nPolymorphic type handling refers to the addition of enough type information so that the deserializer can instantiate the appropriate subtype of a value. Use of \"default typing\" is considered dangerous due to the possibility of an untrusted method (gadget) managing to specify a class that is accessible through the class-loader and therefore, exposing a set of methods and/or fields.\n\n### 3. An exploitable gadget class is available for the attacker to leverage \n\nGadget chains are specially crafted method sequences that can be created by an attacker in order to change the flow of code execution. These gadgets are often methods introduced by third-party components which an attacker could utilise in order to attack the target application. Not every gadget out there is supported by `jackson-databind`. The maintainers of `jackson-databind` proactively blacklists possible serialization gadgets in an attempt to ensure that it is not possible for an attacker to chain gadgets during serialization. \n\n### Further reading:\n\n - [On Jackson CVEs: Donâ€™t Panic on Medium](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n - [NCC Group Jackson Deserialization WhitePaper](https://www.nccgroup.com/globalassets/our-research/us/whitepapers/2018/jackson_deserialization.pdf)\n - [Java Security Best Practices](https://snyk.io/blog/10-java-security-best-practices/)\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.6.7.4, 2.9.10.4 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2682)\n- [Medium Post](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n",

      "description": "## Overview\n[com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind) is a library which contains the general-purpose data-binding functionality and tree-model for Jackson Data Processor.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Deserialization of Untrusted Data. It is possible to conduct a Deserialization attack using any of the following class gadget available within `weblogic/oracle-aqjms` if polymorphic type handling is enabled and an application using this package allows user input which gets deserialized. \r\n\r\n* oracle.jms.AQjmsQueueConnectionFactory\r\n* oracle.jms.AQjmsXATopicConnectionFactory\r\n* oracle.jms.AQjmsTopicConnectionFactory\r\n* oracle.jms.AQjmsXAQueueConnectionFactory\r\n* oracle.jms.AQjmsXAConnectionFactory\r\n\r\nNote: This vulnerability does not affect release `2.10.0` onward.\n\n## Details\n\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating objects from a  sequence of bytes is called deserialization. _Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)) occurs when an application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, allowing the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\n`com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` allows deserialization of JSON input to Java objects. If an application using this dependency has the ability to deserialize a JSON string from an untrusted source, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to conduct deserialization attacks.\n\nExploitation of unsafe deserialization attacks through `jackson-databind` requires the following prerequisites: \n\n### 1. The target application allowing JSON user input which is processed by jackson-databind\n\nAn application using `jackson-databind` is only vulnerable if a user-provided JSON data is deserialized. \n\n### 2. Polymorphic type handling for properties with nominal type are enabled\n\nPolymorphic type handling refers to the addition of enough type information so that the deserializer can instantiate the appropriate subtype of a value. Use of \"default typing\" is considered dangerous due to the possibility of an untrusted method (gadget) managing to specify a class that is accessible through the class-loader and therefore, exposing a set of methods and/or fields.\n\n### 3. An exploitable gadget class is available for the attacker to leverage \n\nGadget chains are specially crafted method sequences that can be created by an attacker in order to change the flow of code execution. These gadgets are often methods introduced by third-party components which an attacker could utilise in order to attack the target application. Not every gadget out there is supported by `jackson-databind`. The maintainers of `jackson-databind` proactively blacklists possible serialization gadgets in an attempt to ensure that it is not possible for an attacker to chain gadgets during serialization. \n\n### Further reading:\n\n - [On Jackson CVEs: Donâ€™t Panic on Medium](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n - [NCC Group Jackson Deserialization WhitePaper](https://www.nccgroup.com/globalassets/our-research/us/whitepapers/2018/jackson_deserialization.pdf)\n - [Java Security Best Practices](https://snyk.io/blog/10-java-security-best-practices/)\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.6.7.4, 2.9.10.5 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2698)\n- [Medium Article](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n",

It mishandles the interaction between serialization gadgets and typing, related to `br.com.anteros.dbcp.AnterosDBCPDataSource` (aka Anteros-DBCP).\n\n## Details\n\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part of popular protocols like _Remote Method Invocation (RMI)_, _Java Management Extension (JMX)_, _Java Messaging System (JMS)_, _Action Message Format (AMF)_, _Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState_, etc.\n\n_Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)), is when the application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\nJava deserialization issues have been known for years. However, interest in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes that could be abused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular library (Apache Commons Collection)](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSCOLLECTIONS-30078). These classes were used in zero-days affecting IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.\n\n  \nAn attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the deserializer, getting the command executed.\n  \n\n> Developers put too much trust in Java Object Serialization. Some even de-serialize objects pre-authentication. When deserializing an Object in Java you typically cast it to an expected type, and therefore Java's strict type system will ensure you only get valid object trees. Unfortunately, by the time the type checking happens, platform code has already created and executed significant logic. So, before the final type is checked a lot of code is executed from the readObject() methods of various objects, all of which is out of the developer's control. By combining the readObject() methods of various classes which are available on the classpath of the vulnerable application an attacker can execute functions (including calling Runtime.exec() to execute local OS commands).\n\n- Apache Blog\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.6.7.4, 2.9.10.6 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2814)\n- [Medium Article](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n- [PoC](https://github.com/Kamimuka/cve-2020-24616-poc)\n",

The reverse process of creating objects from a  sequence of bytes is called deserialization. _Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)) occurs when an application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, allowing the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\n`com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` allows deserialization of JSON input to Java objects. If an application using this dependency has the ability to deserialize a JSON string from an untrusted source, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to conduct deserialization attacks.\n\nExploitation of unsafe deserialization attacks through `jackson-databind` requires the following prerequisites: \n\n### 1.

An exploitable gadget class is available for the attacker to leverage \n\nGadget chains are specially crafted method sequences that can be created by an attacker in order to change the flow of code execution. These gadgets are often methods introduced by third-party components which an attacker could utilise in order to attack the target application. Not every gadget out there is supported by `jackson-databind`. The maintainers of `jackson-databind` proactively blacklists possible serialization gadgets in an attempt to ensure that it is not possible for an attacker to chain gadgets during serialization. \n\n### Further reading:\n\n - [On Jackson CVEs: Donâ€™t Panic on Medium](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n - [NCC Group Jackson Deserialization WhitePaper](https://www.nccgroup.com/globalassets/our-research/us/whitepapers/2018/jackson_deserialization.pdf)\n - [Java Security Best Practices](https://snyk.io/blog/10-java-security-best-practices/)\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.6.7.3, 2.7.9.4, 2.8.11.2, 2.9.6 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/7487cf7eb14be2f65a1eb108e8629c07ef45e0a1)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2052)\n",

An attacker could perform a Remote Code Execution attacks via the ` slf4j-ext` gadget due to an incomplete fix for the [CVE-2017-7525](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMFASTERXMLJACKSONCORE-31507) deserialization flaw.\r\n\r\n**Note:** This vulnerability (`CVE-2018-14718`) is not identical to `CVE-2018-12019`, `CVE-2018-14720`, `CVE-2018-14721`, `CVE-2018-14722`,`CVE-2018-12023` and `CVE-2018-11307`.\n\n## Details\n\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating objects from a  sequence of bytes is called deserialization. _Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)) occurs when an application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, allowing the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\n`com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` allows deserialization of JSON input to Java objects. If an application using this dependency has the ability to deserialize a JSON string from an untrusted source, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to conduct deserialization attacks.\n\nExploitation of unsafe deserialization attacks through `jackson-databind` requires the following prerequisites: \n\n### 1. The target application allowing JSON user input which is processed by jackson-databind\n\nAn application using `jackson-databind` is only vulnerable if a user-provided JSON data is deserialized. \n\n### 2. Polymorphic type handling for properties with nominal type are enabled\n\nPolymorphic type handling refers to the addition of enough type information so that the deserializer can instantiate the appropriate subtype of a value. Use of \"default typing\" is considered dangerous due to the possibility of an untrusted method (gadget) managing to specify a class that is accessible through the class-loader and therefore, exposing a set of methods and/or fields.\n\n### 3. An exploitable gadget class is available for the attacker to leverage \n\nGadget chains are specially crafted method sequences that can be created by an attacker in order to change the flow of code execution. These gadgets are often methods introduced by third-party components which an attacker could utilise in order to attack the target application. Not every gadget out there is supported by `jackson-databind`. The maintainers of `jackson-databind` proactively blacklists possible serialization gadgets in an attempt to ensure that it is not possible for an attacker to chain gadgets during serialization. \n\n### Further reading:\n\n - [On Jackson CVEs: Donâ€™t Panic on Medium](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n - [NCC Group Jackson Deserialization WhitePaper](https://www.nccgroup.com/globalassets/our-research/us/whitepapers/2018/jackson_deserialization.pdf)\n - [Java Security Best Practices](https://snyk.io/blog/10-java-security-best-practices/)\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.6.7.3, 2.7.9.5, 2.8.11.3, 2.9.7 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/87d29af25e82a249ea15858e2d4ecbf64091db44)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2097)\n",

      "description": "## Overview\n[com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind) is a library which contains the general-purpose data-binding functionality and tree-model for Jackson Data Processor.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Deserialization of Untrusted Data. An attacker could perform a Remote Code Execution attack via the `blaze-ds-opt` gadget due to an incomplete fix for the [CVE-2017-7525](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMFASTERXMLJACKSONCORE-31507) deserialization flaw.\r\n\r\n**Note:** This vulnerability (`CVE-2018-14719`) is not identical to `CVE-2018-12018`, `CVE-2018-14720`, `CVE-2018-14721`, `CVE-2018-14722`,`CVE-2018-12023` and `CVE-2018-11307`.\n\n## Details\n\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating objects from a  sequence of bytes is called deserialization. _Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)) occurs when an application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, allowing the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\n`com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` allows deserialization of JSON input to Java objects. If an application using this dependency has the ability to deserialize a JSON string from an untrusted source, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to conduct deserialization attacks.\n\nExploitation of unsafe deserialization attacks through `jackson-databind` requires the following prerequisites: \n\n### 1. The target application allowing JSON user input which is processed by jackson-databind\n\nAn application using `jackson-databind` is only vulnerable if a user-provided JSON data is deserialized. \n\n### 2. Polymorphic type handling for properties with nominal type are enabled\n\nPolymorphic type handling refers to the addition of enough type information so that the deserializer can instantiate the appropriate subtype of a value. Use of \"default typing\" is considered dangerous due to the possibility of an untrusted method (gadget) managing to specify a class that is accessible through the class-loader and therefore, exposing a set of methods and/or fields.\n\n### 3. An exploitable gadget class is available for the attacker to leverage \n\nGadget chains are specially crafted method sequences that can be created by an attacker in order to change the flow of code execution. These gadgets are often methods introduced by third-party components which an attacker could utilise in order to attack the target application. Not every gadget out there is supported by `jackson-databind`. The maintainers of `jackson-databind` proactively blacklists possible serialization gadgets in an attempt to ensure that it is not possible for an attacker to chain gadgets during serialization. \n\n### Further reading:\n\n - [On Jackson CVEs: Donâ€™t Panic on Medium](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n - [NCC Group Jackson Deserialization WhitePaper](https://www.nccgroup.com/globalassets/our-research/us/whitepapers/2018/jackson_deserialization.pdf)\n - [Java Security Best Practices](https://snyk.io/blog/10-java-security-best-practices/)\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.6.7.3, 2.7.9.5, 2.8.11.3, 2.9.7 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/87d29af25e82a249ea15858e2d4ecbf64091db44)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2097)\n- [GitHub Release Notes](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/blob/a066415d66a6b1a4688ff0ed25695aa3a86ac130/release-notes/VERSION-2.x)\n",

      "description": "## Overview\n[com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-core](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core) is a Core Jackson abstractions, basic JSON streaming API implementation\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS). If the REST endpoint consumes POST requests with JSON or XML data and data are invalid, the first unrecognized token is printed to server.log\r\n> If the first token is word of length 10MB, the whole word is printed. This is potentially dangerous and can be used to attack the server by filling the disk with logs.\n\n## Details\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.\n\nUnlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\n\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\n\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\n\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\n\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\n\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ws:20171108)\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-core` to version 2.8.6 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/pull/322)\n- [Jira Issue](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBEAP-6316)\n",
